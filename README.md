**Recommendation for beginners**: Start with VS Code - it's free, powerful, and has the largest community support.

### 🚀 Running Your Code: Step by Step

#### 📄 HTML Files
1. **Create an HTML file**:
   - Open your code editor
   - Create a new file with `.html` extension (e.g., `index.html`)
   - Add basic HTML structure (see [HTML Roadmap](./HTML-ROADMAP.md))

2. **Run HTML files**:
   - **Method 1**: Double-click the HTML file to open in your browser
   - **Method 2**: Right-click > Open with > Choose your browser
   - **Method 3**: Drag and drop the HTML file into an open browser window
   - **Method 4**: Use Live Server extension in VS Code:
     1. Install "Live Server" extension
     2. Right-click on your HTML file
     3. Select "Open with Live Server"

#### 🎨 CSS Files
1. **Create a CSS file**:
   - Create a new file with `.css` extension (e.g., `styles.css`)
   - Write your CSS rules (see [CSS Roadmap](./CSS-ROADMAP.md))

2. **Link CSS to HTML**:
   ```html
   <head>
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
   </head>
   ```

3. **Run CSS**:
   - CSS doesn't run independently - it works when linked to HTML
   - Open your HTML file using any method above
   - Changes to CSS will reflect when you refresh the browser

#### 📊 JavaScript Files
1. **Create a JavaScript file**:
   - Create a new file with `.js` extension (e.g., `script.js`)
   - Write your JavaScript code (see [JavaScript Roadmap](./JAVASCRIPT-ROADMAP.md))

2. **Link JavaScript to HTML**:
   ```html
   <!-- At the bottom of your body tag -->
   <body>
     <!-- Your HTML content -->
     <script src="script.js"></script>
   </body>
   ```

3. **Run JavaScript**:
   - JavaScript runs when loaded by HTML file
   - Open your HTML file using any method above
   - For testing JavaScript directly:
     1. Open browser developer tools (F12 or Right-click > Inspect)
     2. Go to "Console" tab
     3. Type JavaScript code directly to see results

### 📱 Testing on Different Devices
1. **Responsive Design Testing**:
   - Use browser developer tools (F12) > Toggle device toolbar
   - Test on various device dimensions

2. **Local Network Testing**:
   - With VS Code Live Server, your site is accessible on your local network
   - Find your computer's IP address
   - Other devices on same network can visit http://your-ip-address:5500

### 📂 Managing Your Project Files
- Keep files organized in folders (e.g., `/css`, `/js`, `/images`)
- Use meaningful filenames (`main.css` instead of `file1.css`)
- Start with `index.html` as your main file (opens by default)

### 🔄 Full HTML/CSS/JS Workflow Example
1. Create project folder
2. Create basic files:
   ```
   my-project/
   ├── index.html
   ├── css/
   │   └── styles.css
   └── js/
       └── script.js
   ```
3. Link them together in `index.html`:
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
     <meta charset="UTF-8">
     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
     <title>My Project</title>
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">
   </head>
   <body>
     <h1>Hello World!</h1>
     <p>My first web project</p>
     
     <script src="js/script.js"></script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```
4. Open with Live Server and start coding!

Now, with your development environment set up, you're ready to begin your web development journey! Follow our detailed roadmaps for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build your skills step by step.

## 🌟 Introduction

Hey there, future developers! I'm Mahendra Mahara, a senior BCA student at Tribhuvan University. I've noticed many of my junior friends and new students want to start web development but feel lost about where to begin.

The typical journey looks like this:
1. Get excited about coding
2. Open YouTube and search "how to learn web development"
3. Get overwhelmed by thousands of videos and contradicting advice
4. Feel confused and eventually quit before really starting

**That stops today!** As a senior, I'm taking responsibility to create a clear, step-by-step roadmap that any beginner can follow – especially designed for Nepali students and our specific learning environment.

## 🌐 How Websites Actually Work

Before diving into code, let's understand how websites function in simple terms:

### The Client-Server Model Simplified

```
    Your Device                              Server
  ┌───────────┐     1. HTTP Request      ┌───────────┐
  │           │ ───────────────────────> │           │
  │  Browser  │                          │  Server   │
  │ (Client)  │ <─────────────────────── │           │
  └───────────┘     2. Response with     └─────┬─────┘
                       HTML/CSS/JS             │
                                               │
                                         ┌─────▼─────┐
                                         │           │
                                         │ Database  │
                                         │           │
                                         └───────────┘
```

**When you visit a website:**

1. **Request**: Your browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) sends a request to a server asking for a specific website (e.g., facebook.com)
2. **Processing**: The server processes your request, possibly retrieving data from a database
3. **Response**: The server sends back HTML (structure), CSS (styles), and JavaScript (interactivity) files
4. **Rendering**: Your browser renders these files to display the website you see
5. **Interaction**: When you interact (click, type, etc.), new requests might be sent to update the page

## 💻 Frontend vs Backend: The Two Sides of Web Development

Think of a website like a restaurant:

### Frontend (The Dining Area)
- **What it is**: Everything users see and interact with
- **Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Real-world parallel**: The dining area, menu design, ambiance, and customer experience
- **What it does**:
  - Creates the structure (HTML)
  - Styles the appearance (CSS)
  - Adds interactivity (JavaScript)

### Backend (The Kitchen)
- **What it is**: Everything happening behind the scenes
- **Technologies**: Node.js, Python, PHP, Ruby, Java, databases like MongoDB or MySQL
- **Real-world parallel**: The kitchen, inventory management, cooking processes
- **What it does**:
  - Processes data and user inputs
  - Communicates with databases
  - Handles authentication (login/signup)
  - Manages server operations and business logic

## 🛠️ Core Technologies You'll Need to Learn

### 1. Frontend Essentials
- **HTML**: Structure and content (like the skeleton)
- **CSS**: Styling and appearance (like the skin and clothes)
- **JavaScript**: Behavior and interactivity (like the muscles and brain)

### 2. Backend Options
- **Node.js**: JavaScript on the server (most popular in 2025)
- **Python**: With frameworks like Django or Flask
- **PHP**: Powers WordPress and many existing sites
- **Others**: Java, Ruby, Go, etc.

### 3. Databases
- **SQL**: MySQL, PostgreSQL (structured data)
- **NoSQL**: MongoDB, Firebase (flexible data)

### 4. Essential Tools
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and code sharing
- **VS Code**: Code editor (industry standard in 2025)
- **Browser DevTools**: For testing and debugging
- **Terminal/Command Line**: For running commands and scripts

## 🐙 GitHub: Your Developer Portfolio

GitHub is like your digital resume as a developer. Every project you build should be uploaded here.

### Why GitHub is Essential:
1. **Shows your skills**: Recruiters check GitHub profiles
2. **Tracks progress**: See how you improve over time
3. **Collaboration**: Work with others on the same code
4. **Portfolio**: Showcase your best projects
5. **Version control**: Track changes and never lose work

### Setting Up GitHub:

1. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com)
2. Follow me: [@mahendramahara](https://github.com/mahendramahara)
3. Install Git on your computer
4. Set up your identity:

```bash
# Configure your identity
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

### Essential Git Commands

#### Basic Workflow:
```bash
# Initialize a new repository
git init

# Check status of your files
git status

# Add files to staging area
git add filename.txt    # Add specific file
git add .               # Add all files

# Commit changes with a message
git commit -m "Your message explaining changes"

# Connect to remote GitHub repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/repo-name.git

# Push your commits to GitHub
git push -u origin main    # First time
git push                   # Subsequent pushes
```

#### Working with Existing Projects:
```bash
# Clone (download) a repository
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git

# Get latest changes from remote
git pull

# See commit history
git log
git log --oneline    # Condensed version
git log --graph      # Visual representation of branches
git log --author="username"  # See commits by specific author
```

#### Branching and Collaboration:
```bash
# Create a new branch
git branch feature-name

# Switch to a branch
git checkout feature-name

# Create and switch in one command
git checkout -b new-feature

# List all branches
git branch
git branch --all     # Show local and remote branches

# Merge a branch into current branch
git merge feature-name

# Delete a branch
git branch -d feature-name    # Safe delete (won't delete unmerged changes)
git branch -D feature-name    # Force delete
```

#### Managing Changes:
```bash
# Discard changes in working directory
git restore filename.txt
git restore .             # All files

# Unstage files (remove from staging area)
git restore --staged filename.txt

# View differences
git diff
git diff --staged    # For staged changes
git diff branch1..branch2  # Compare branches

# Revert a commit (creates new commit that undoes changes)
git revert commit-hash

# Reset to specific commit (caution: can lose work)
git reset --soft commit-hash   # Preserves changes as staged
git reset --mixed commit-hash  # Default: keeps changes but unstaged
git reset --hard commit-hash   # Discards all changes (dangerous!)
```

#### Advanced Git Features:
```bash
# Create .gitignore file to exclude files
echo "node_modules/" > .gitignore
echo "*.log" >> .gitignore
echo ".env" >> .gitignore

# Save changes temporarily
git stash
git stash save "Work in progress on feature X"  # With description
git stash list                                  # View stashed changes
git stash pop                                   # Apply and remove latest stash
git stash apply                                 # Apply but keep in stash list
git stash drop                                  # Remove latest stash
git stash clear                                 # Remove all stashes

# Tag important milestones
git tag v1.0.0
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Version 1.0.0 release"
git push --tags                                 # Push tags to remote
git tag -d v1.0.0                               # Delete tag

# Fix merge conflicts
# (Edit files to resolve markers, then:)
git add .
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
```

#### Advanced Branch Management:
```bash
# Rebasing (reapplies your commits on top of another branch)
git rebase main                 # Rebase current branch onto main
git rebase --interactive HEAD~3 # Interactive rebase for last 3 commits

# Cherry-picking (apply specific commits to current branch)
git cherry-pick commit-hash     # Apply a specific commit

# Fetch remote changes without merging
git fetch                       # Get remote changes
git fetch --prune               # Clean up deleted remote branches
```

#### Remote Repository Management:
```bash
# Add multiple remotes
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/repo.git

# View remote repositories
git remote -v

# Remove remote
git remote remove remote-name

# Rename remote
git remote rename old-name new-name

# Update remote URL
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/new-repo-name.git
```

#### Useful Tricks and Rescue Commands:
```bash
# Save credentials (avoid typing password repeatedly)
git config --global credential.helper store

# View changes by author
git blame filename.txt

# Find which commit introduced a bug
git bisect start
git bisect bad                  # Mark current state as buggy
git bisect good commit-hash     # Mark known good state
# Git will checkout different commits for you to test
# After testing each state, mark it:
git bisect good                 # If this commit doesn't have the bug
git bisect bad                  # If this commit has the bug
# When finished:
git bisect reset

# Recover deleted commits (within 30 days)
git reflog                      # View history of HEAD movements
git checkout HEAD@{1}           # Go to previous HEAD state

# Clean repository
git clean -n                    # Dry run (shows what would be deleted)
git clean -df                   # Delete untracked files and directories
```

### GitHub Collaboration Workflow

The standard way teams collaborate using GitHub:

1. **Fork the repository** - Create your own copy on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** - `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repo.git`
3. **Create a feature branch** - `git checkout -b feature-name`
4. **Make your changes** - Write code and commit regularly
5. **Push to your fork** - `git push -u origin feature-name`
6. **Create a Pull Request** - Request project maintainers to review and merge your changes
7. **Address feedback** - Make requested changes and push again
8. **Merge** - Project maintainers merge your code when ready

#### Why Branching is Essential:

1. **Isolation** - Work on features without affecting the main codebase
2. **Collaboration** - Multiple developers can work on different features simultaneously
3. **Review** - Code can be reviewed before being merged into main
4. **Experimentation** - Try new ideas without risk
5. **Releases** - Maintain different versions of your software

#### Git Branch Strategy (GitHub Flow):

1. **main/master** - Always stable and deployable
2. **feature branches** - Created from main for each new feature
3. **hotfix branches** - For urgent bug fixes
4. **Pull Requests** - The mechanism for code review and discussion

### Best Practices for GitHub:
- Commit often with clear messages
- Create a new branch for each feature/fix
- Use pull requests for team review
- Write a good README.md for each project
- Update your repositories regularly
- **Never commit sensitive data** (passwords, API keys)

✅ **Daily Task**: Make at least one meaningful commit to GitHub every day. This builds your profile and keeps your projects updated.
